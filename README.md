Supert — da har jeg samlet alt til én helhetlig README.md som du kan legge rett på GitHub (eller lagre lokalt).

Nedenfor er den ferdige versjonen, profesjonell, tydelig på målgruppen, klinisk solid og ærlig om hva som er ferdig og hva som kommer.

🎙 FemVoice Studio — Intelligent Voice Feminization Biofeedback System

FemVoice Studio is a real-time, clinically-informed voice training platform designed specifically to support transfeminine individuals (trans girls and women) in developing a more feminine speaking voice in a safe, adaptive, and sustainable way.

Unlike traditional pitch-focused voice apps, FemVoice Studio prioritizes vocal resonance shaping, tonal stability, and vocal health — the key factors that determine perceived vocal femininity.

🌱 Core Training Philosophy

✔ Resonance-first feminization (formant-based, not pitch chasing)
✔ Adaptive progression per individual user
✔ Real-time biofeedback learning
✔ Vocal health protection & strain prevention
✔ Intelligent hydration support (in development)
✔ Research-based aggregate clinical framework

🧠 Core Technology

Built with:

.NET 10

WPF (MVVM architecture)

NAudio for real-time audio processing

FFT + formant analysis

Event-driven service architecture

Clean Architecture with dependency injection

Comprehensive unit testing

🔬 Core Systems
🎯 ResonanceProxyEngine

Real-time extraction of formant frequencies (F1/F2/F3), spectral brightness, and resonance stability to quantify feminine vocal resonance.

📊 FemVoiceScoreEngine

Adaptive composite scoring with personal baselines, long-term trend detection, plateau and regression monitoring.

🧬 ComfortZoneController

Dynamic pitch safety boundaries with automatic expansion, contraction, and strain protection.

🤖 SmartCoachEngine

Context-aware real-time coaching integrated directly into training exercises.

🎧 Real-Time Visual Feedback

Live pitch graph

Live spectrogram with resonance intelligence

Stability and comfort indicators

💧 Vocal Health & Hydration Support

FemVoice Studio includes built-in vocal health monitoring to help prevent strain and fatigue during training sessions.

A planned hydration reminder system will intelligently prompt users to drink water when acoustic signals indicate dryness or increased vocal effort — based on real voice behavior such as:

• rising instability
• darker resonance patterns
• increasing strain indicators
• extended training load

This ensures safe, sustainable voice feminization practice.

🎯 Why FemVoice Studio Is Different

Most voice training apps focus primarily on raising pitch.

FemVoice Studio trains:

✔ vocal tract resonance
✔ tonal stability
✔ safe progression
✔ real-time acoustic awareness

This reflects modern clinical voice feminization research rather than outdated pitch-only models.

⚠ Disclaimer

FemVoice Studio is a training support tool and not a replacement for professional speech therapy.
Users experiencing vocal discomfort or pain should consult a qualified speech-language pathologist.
